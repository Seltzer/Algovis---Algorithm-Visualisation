Parameter copy semantics:
	This is a contract defined by some methods to establish ownership rules for parameters. A method
	declared to use these semantics makes copies of its parameters... therefore the method owns these
	copies and the caller owns the originals and is free to dispose of them after the method invocation
	if desired.
	
	Obviously in C++, value types are copied and ref/pointer types are shallow copied without choice, but
	these semantics imply that ref/pointers passed as parameters will also be deep copied.
