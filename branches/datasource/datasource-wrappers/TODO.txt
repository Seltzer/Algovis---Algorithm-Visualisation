cumulative adding
size_type
fix play button


* Test deque
* Implement assign and pop stuff for vector and deque and rest of StringWrapper
* Implement basic matrix stuff
* Vary animation durations for different actions
* Fix backtracking and implement undo for other actions
* Highlight operands for non-sibling types
* Write MapWrapper, and VO_Map
* Improve the UI and fix dodgy stuff:
	- Fix window resizing
	- Add snap to current viewable feature
	- Make buttons
* Remove SINGLE_PRINTABLE hackery (mostly removed at this stage)
* Support custom types by displaying a generic 'user-defined type pic'
* Improve layout manager so that Viewable translations can trigger layout recalculation, not just 
			Viewable resizes
* Display contents of custom types when the user mouses over the user-defined type pic
* Implement drawing for pointer types 
* Implement stats module
* Port to Linux
* Turn algovis c++ into a DLL

***** BUGS *****
* Ambiguous < op when using vec.size_type
* Deal with assertion in DS_CreateSP::PrepareToPerform that is predicated on the array being registered

**** THOUGHTS ****
* How to deal with "unsigned char"
* Array deregistration...
* Allow users to orient arrays vertically as well as horizontally - could be useful when drawing
		arrays of arrays.
