************ need to get this stuff done **********************
* Test History stuff (cumulative adding, etc.) - test with different actionbuffer sizes, allow user to set
          actionbuffer size
* Finish and test wrappers
* Add transpose animation
* backtracking/forwardtracking
* Highlight operands for non-sibling types
* Fix testing and communicationWithViewEnabled

************ maybe **********************
* Remove SINGLE_PRINTABLE hackery amap (mostly removed at this stage)
* Improve layout manager so that Viewable translations can trigger layout recalculation, not just 
			Viewable resizes
* Write MapWrapper, and VO_Map
* Improve the UI and fix dodgy stuff:
	- Fix window resizing
	- Add snap to current viewable feature
	- Make buttons or at least fix the play button


************ probably won't get this stuff done **********************
* Support custom types by displaying a generic 'user-defined type pic'
* Display contents of custom types when the user mouses over the user-defined type pic
* Vary animation durations for different actions
* Implement drawing for pointer types 
* Implement stats module
* Port to Linux
* Turn algovis c++ into a DLL


**** THOUGHTS ****
* How to deal with "unsigned char"
* Allow users to orient arrays vertically as well as horizontally - could be useful when drawing
		arrays of arrays.
