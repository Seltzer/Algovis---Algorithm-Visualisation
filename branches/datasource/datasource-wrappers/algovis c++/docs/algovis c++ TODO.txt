Functionality:
* Finish vector (esp. vector resizing)
* Do other STL types and primitives
* Implement a graphs library
* Deal with unsigned types
* Deal with non-type template parameter problem


Testing:
* Write more unit-tests
* Test algovis c++ against existing code 
		(we know it's incompatible with some boost libraries as they use non-type template parameters)

Bugs:
* PrimitiveWrapper unary increment/decrement ops
